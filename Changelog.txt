CURRENT STATE
-------------
- Inventory system implemented (counts + weight).
- Equipment system implemented with real APIs:
  - try_equip(inventory, item_id, slot)
  - try_unequip(inventory, slot)
- No UI yet by design.
- AttackProfiles + combat resolver intact.
- Player can hold items; equipping logic is ready but not yet wired to input/UI.
- Pickup.tscn + drop_item_from_player planned / partially implemented.

IMPORTANT DESIGN DECISIONS
--------------------------
- No debug hacks: all equip/unequip/drop actions must go through real APIs.
- UI (drag/drop) will call the same functions used by temporary hotkeys.
- Items are Resources (ItemDef); inventory/equipment store item_id references.
- Weight penalties already affect movement; later extend to combat stats.

NEXT STEPS (IN ORDER)
---------------------
1) Add temporary hotkeys:
   - E → try_equip weapon slot
   - U → try_unequip weapon slot
   - Q → drop_item_from_player(item_id, 1)
   (Only for testing; will be removed when UI exists)

2) Print equipment state after equip/unequip to verify correctness.

3) Finish Pickup.tscn behavior:
   - On player overlap → add item back to inventory → destroy pickup.

4) After mechanics are verified, build UI:
   - Inventory grid
   - Drag item → equipment slot → try_equip
   - Drag item → world → drop_item_from_player

DO NOT
------
- Do NOT add UI before mechanics are proven.
- Do NOT bypass try_equip / try_unequip.
- Do NOT let combat logic read inventory directly.
